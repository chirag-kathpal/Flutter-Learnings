// Flutter - A Tool that allows you to build  native cross platform
//(Android, ios, web, desktop) applications using one programming language and codebase

// Difference between native, Hybrid and cross platform development

// Benifits of Flutter 
// 1. Same Ui and business logic in all platforms
// 2. Increased time to market speed 
// 3. reduced code development time 
// 4. the potential ability to go beyond mobile 
// 5. custom , animated UI of any complexity available 
// 6. similar to native app performance 
// 7. own rendering engine
// 8. Simple platform specific logic implementation 

// Flutter Architecture 
// Flutter is all about widgets, we have to build widget tree when building UI 
// Flutter is a framework that allows us to build UI in a platform independent way
// UI components and logic both are in single Language DART unlike other platforms 

// create a flutter project - flutter create appName 

// .idea - it contains our code editor project related setting specific files
// android - contains android platform specific settings, code and resources,
// if we need any platform specific changes, we need to change the code here 

// build - contains the output generated when you build or run the project
// all release related file/folders like apk 

// ios 
// lib - main folder where we  will write all the flutter app related codes 
// main.dart is entry point for the flutter app 

// test - it is set to contain any tetsing related codes that you write
// like test/testcases code 

// .gitignore - git specific file (include/exclude any file/folders as you need)

// .metadata - Flutter project related metadata that flutter tool uses
// not make any manual changes in it 

// .packages - conatins many libaries and packages, some packages are preinstalled with flutter
// while others are downloaded during development 
// it holds the path to each of the library/packages in local system 

// pubspec.lock - dependent on pubspec.yaml file 
// helper file created next to pubspec.yaml

// pubspec.yaml - contains flutter app specific metadata and configurations
// external packages, image assets,font files, app versions etc.
